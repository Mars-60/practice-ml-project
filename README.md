# 🤖 Machine Learning Practice Projects

This repository contains my machine learning practice work and small projects built while learning Scikit-Learn and data preprocessing.

It includes:
- 🏠 Housing Price Prediction (end-to-end ML pipeline)
- 🌸 Iris Dataset notebooks (ML fundamentals & preprocessing)

## 🏠 Housing Price Prediction Project

This project predicts **median house values** using housing dataset features such as income, rooms, population, and location.

### What this project demonstrates
- Data preprocessing using Scikit-Learn pipelines  
- Handling missing values  
- Feature scaling  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Training a Random Forest model  
- Saving and loading the model for future predictions  

### Model Used
**RandomForestRegressor**

## 🌸 Iris Dataset Machine Learning Practice

Alongside the housing project, I practiced core machine learning concepts using the **Iris dataset**.  
This helped me understand the full ML workflow before moving to larger projects.

### What I Learned
- Loading and exploring datasets  
- Data visualization and analysis  
- Creating training and testing datasets  
- Feature scaling and preprocessing  
- Building Scikit-Learn pipelines  
- Training classification models  
- Evaluating model performance and accuracy  

This practice formed the foundation for building the housing price prediction pipeline and understanding real-world ML workflows.
